Iâ€™m @rirum but you can call me âœ¨ riru âœ¨  or cami (she/her)<br>
Iâ€™m interested in getting better at programming and learn React. Also :ribbon: magical girls, :microphone: screamo and :sewing_needle: embroidery.<br>
Currently studying on Driven Education to be a FullStack Dev :writing_hand:<br>
